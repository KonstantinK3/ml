    "This understanding of how convolutions work are the foundation of how Convolutional Neural Networks work. After this tuorial you are supposed to understand the underlying mathematical concepts and how to apply them using| Python (numpy) and Tensorflow. The next setp is to extrapolate this knowledge to Machine Learning applications."
